# CodeFactory Roadmap

## Current Status: Alpha

CodeFactory core is functional and includes GitHub Copilot integration. Not yet published to JSR.

---

## Phase 1: Core Foundation ‚úÖ DONE

- [x] Factory class with template execution
- [x] FactoryRegistry for managing factories
- [x] Template engine with `{{variable}}` substitution
- [x] `defineFactory()` builder for easy factory creation
- [x] Meta-factory (`define_factory`) for creating factories
- [x] Built-in factories shipped with the library
- [x] Demo application showcasing usage
- [x] Create CLI tool (`create-codefactory`)
- [x] Project template with examples

## Phase 2: AI Integration ‚úÖ DONE

- [x] GitHub Copilot slash commands via `.github/prompts/`
- [x] `/codefactory.list` - List available factories
- [x] `/codefactory.use` - Execute a factory
- [x] `/codefactory.create` - Define new factory
- [x] Natural language support through prompt files
- [x] Zero-installation integration (spec-kit pattern)

## Phase 3: JSR Publication üöß IN PROGRESS

### Packages to Publish

1. **@codefactory/core** - Core library
   - Factory and FactoryRegistry classes
   - Template engine
   - Built-in factories
   - TypeScript types

2. **@codefactory/create** - Project scaffolding
   - CLI tool for creating projects
   - Project template with GitHub Copilot integration
   - Example factories

### Tasks

- [ ] Add JSR-specific metadata to `deno.json` files
- [ ] Test publishing to JSR (dry run)
- [ ] Publish @codefactory/core v0.1.0
- [ ] Publish @codefactory/create v0.1.0
- [ ] Update template imports to use JSR packages
- [ ] Test end-to-end: `deno run jsr:@codefactory/create my-app`

## Phase 4: Real-World Testing üìã PLANNED

### Community Feedback
- [ ] Share with early adopters
- [ ] Gather feedback on API design
- [ ] Collect real factory examples from users
- [ ] Identify pain points and missing features

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Video/GIF demonstrations of Copilot integration
- [ ] Factory authoring guide
- [ ] Best practices document
- [ ] Migration guide (if breaking changes needed)

### Examples
- [ ] React component factories
- [ ] REST API endpoint factories
- [ ] Test file generators
- [ ] Database schema factories
- [ ] CI/CD configuration factories

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features üîÆ FUTURE

### Factory Improvements
- [ ] Conditional logic in templates (`{{#if}}`)
- [ ] Loops in templates (`{{#each}}`)
- [ ] Factory composition (factories calling factories)
- [ ] Template inheritance/extension
- [ ] Validation rules for parameters
- [ ] Default parameter values

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Factory linter (validate factory definitions)
- [ ] Factory testing utilities
- [ ] Factory documentation generator
- [ ] Interactive factory creator (CLI wizard)
- [ ] Factory marketplace/catalog

### Integrations
- [ ] VS Code extension (Language Model Tools API)
  - Real-time validation
  - IntelliSense for factory names
  - Parameter auto-completion
  - Factory preview
- [ ] Support for other AI assistants (Claude, Cursor)
- [ ] GitHub Actions for factory validation
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for factory testing

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-file generation (one factory ‚Üí multiple files)
- [ ] File modification (not just creation)
- [ ] Template hot-reload during development
- [ ] Factory versioning and compatibility
- [ ] Plugin system for custom template engines
- [ ] Factory analytics (which are most used?)

## Phase 6: Ecosystem üåç VISION

### Community
- [ ] Factory registry/marketplace
- [ ] Share and discover factories
- [ ] Factory collections by framework/language
- [ ] Community voting on best factories
- [ ] Factory of the Month showcase

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Private factory registries
- [ ] Team factory sharing
- [ ] Factory governance and approval workflows
- [ ] Audit logs for factory usage
- [ ] Factory performance metrics

### Language Support
- [ ] Python factory runtime
- [ ] JavaScript/Node factory runtime
- [ ] Go factory runtime
- [ ] Universal factory format (language-agnostic)
